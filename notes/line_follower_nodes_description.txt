DESCRIPTION OF ROS NODES USED BY THE TIME OF 1ST EXAM (LINE FOLLOWING)
======================================================================

Our program consists of several nodes with unique roles.
The main node is responsible for overall state of the robot and
all the other nodes are handling various robot subsystems.
Main node listens for events and changing values from sensors and changes
the state of our robot which is represented by LED lights and position. 


MAIN NODE
---------

- publishes     requested LED colors    (for IO node)
- publishes     speed values            (for motors node)

- subscribes    current encoder values  (from encoders node)
- subscribes    discr. line position    (from line node)
- subscribes    contin. line position   (from line node)
- subscribes    pressed button number   (from io node)


- will maybe publish in better units for motors node


MOTORS NODE
-----------

- publishes     speed values    (for hardware motors)

- subscribes    speed values    (from main node)


- will maybe use kinematics to translate another values from main node to speeds ?


ENCODERS NODE
-------------

- publishes     current encoder values      (for main node)

- subscribes    current encoder values      (from hardware encoders)


- will maybe use kinematics to translate encoder tics to another values ?


LINE NODE
---------

- publishes     discrete line position      (for main node)
- publishes     continuous line position    (for main node)

- subscribes    reflected light intensity   (from hardware sensors)


IO NODE
-------

- publishes     pressed button number   (for main node)
- publishes     RGB color values        (for hardware LEDs)

- subscribes    requested LED colors    (from main node)
- subscribes    pressed button number   (from hardware buttons)
